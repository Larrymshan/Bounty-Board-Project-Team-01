Bounty Board Release notes

November 11, 2024

Bounty board now includes multiple new features. There is an updated nav
bar with search functionality. Users can write and post reviews. Users
can view reviews sent from other users. We have updated our login
feature and implemented a logout system.

Updated nav bar:

This release comes with a navbar that displays links to important pages
users can navigate to. We have designed a search bar that users can use
to search for other users and bounties. The functionality of the search
bar will fully be implemented in future versions of Bounty Board.

Post reviews:

This release supports user reviews. If a user has completed a bounty the
bounty poster is now able to review this user. The poster simply needs
to click the "Write a review" tab on the nav bar and fill out the review
form. This response will then be saved into our secure database.

Write Messages:

This release coomes with a limited capability to send messages. The full 
functionality will be implemented in future versions.

View reviews:

We have also introduced a way for users to view reviews they have
received as well as written for other users. Clicking on the "Your
reviews" tab now takes users to a table populated with reviews written
for them with the option to navigate to views written by them.

Logout functionality:

Users can now exit their current session by logging out of Bounty Board
by clicking the "Logout" tab in the navbar. If successfully logged out
users are taken to a screen showing a logged out successfully message.
